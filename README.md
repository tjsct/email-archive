# Emails

When the `ceph` cluster went
[down](https://documentation.tjhsst.edu/machines/history/2018-cephpocalypse)
in late 2018, the [lists.tjhsst.edu](lists.tjhsst.edu) mailing list
manager went down with it (it ran [GNU mailman](https://list.org/) with
[hyperkitty](https://docs.mailman3.org/projects/hyperkitty/en/latest/)
as an archiver and
[postorius](https://docs.mailman3.org/projects/postorius/en/latest/)
for a web interface). SCT used the mailing list to send emails
to their members and has not made an email list since.

This repository holds the emails I could get from spelunking
the remains of a backup of `ceph`. Special thanks to [Yusuf
Bham](https://github.com/fifty-six) for technical support.

For security and privacy reasons, only SCT-related emails are provided in this
repository. See [instructions.md](./instructions.md) for more information.
